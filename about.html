                        I am a graduate of the Marriage and Family Therapy Masters Program at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. In addition to owning and operating <a href="https://enrichedlivingcounseling.com/">Enriched Living Counseling</a>, I am a Community Program Supervisor at The Family Institute at Northwestern and an Elected Member of the Board of Directors for the Illinois Affiliation of Marriage & Family Therapists. 
                    </p>    

                    <p class="text-faded">
                        After gaining clinical experience with the Betty D. Harris Family Clinic located at the Family Institute, I joined the group at Spring Tree Counseling. I practiced at Spring Tree Counseling for four years before opening Enriched Living Counseling. I work with individuals and couples with an emphasis on infidelity, couples in high conflict, interfaith, interracial, and multicultural couples. In addition, I work with couples and individuals who are navigating transitions such as retirement, grief, fertility challenges, dating, and divorce. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-faded">
                        Prior to returning to graduate school in 2014, I spent my first career working in Criminal Justice, Juvenile Justice, and Social Services. After almost ten years of working in that field, I intentionally decided to pursue Marriage and Family therapy to strengthen families and improve the quality of life for couples and individuals in mental and emotional distress. I believe the quality of our relationships greatly impacts our quality of life. Therefore, I work through a systemic lens to find ways to improve the overall quality of relationships including work, family, romantic relationships and child/parent dynamics.  
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-faded">
                        I enjoy working collaboratively with clients to help identify and address presenting concerns. I seek to provide a safe place in my counseling office for clients to engage in and develop new strategies for improving daily life. I value working with client feedback and integrating various theoretical approaches and techniques that uniquely fit each client.
